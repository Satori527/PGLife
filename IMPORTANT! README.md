# PGLife
PGLife is a Full Stack Web App utilizing React.js, PHP, and MySQL, catering to a PG booking site designed for students.

The project was developed while I was learning various technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, JSX, AJAX, DBMS, PHP, and React.js. The final project culminated in a React App that encompasses both Front-End and Back-End components.

FRONT-END
To See the Front End of the Web App You can see the Images I have Included in PGLife_Site_Preview Folder.

BACK-END
The back-end is a locally hosted development environment created using XAMPP's Apache and MySQL components. The data required for the Front-End is stored in SQL files. Without XAMPP's simulated server, direct viewing of the Front-End may not be possible. However, I have provided the database queries and data.
